An ListView support "pull down refresh" and "pull up load" feature.

How to use:
    Just replace ListView by me.maxwin.XListView.

ChangeLogs:
1, the attribute of 'pull_to_bottom_refresh' was added.
2, the attribute of 'pull_to_top_load_more' was added.

so, you could set 'setPullRefreshEnable(boolean)' and 'setPullLoadEnable(boolean)' by layout files not by codes.


Feature needed:

1, when the height of XListView's content is lower than the height of XListView, the footerview need to be gone/invisible automatically.

when I was available and found a solution of it, I would complete this. Wait, please.
